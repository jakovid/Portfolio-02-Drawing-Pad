# Portfolio-02-Drawing-Pad

This project is a browser based sketch pad that allows users to draw on various sizes of boards.

This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS.

HTML was used to create the primary buttons and the layout of the website.

JS was used to create dynamic DOM elements, such as the grid and grid boxes.

The project focuses on the use of modular JS.

Webpack was used to compile the modules.

Key functions this project utilizes are:
1) self-invoking function to auto generate a default sketchpad
2) the ability to choose between a black marker, a random marker, and an eraser
3) auto-generate a random HSL code to randomize color for each square
4) the ability to turn on and turn off the marker
5) the ability to reset the entire sketchpad grid
6) the ability to change the sketch pad dimensions between 2x2 to 100x100
7) auto-updating the DOM to let the user know the current size of grid and the color selected
